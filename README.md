# ANNDatasets

Easy-to-use datasets for ANN benchmark. A MAKE command is all you need.

## Download and Decompress Target Dataset

Goto the subdirectory of target dataset you want to get.

For example, to get SIFT-1M dataset, run:

```bash
cd ./sift-1m
```

Then run:

```bash
make all
```

## Clean Target Dataset

-   `make clean`: Delete the extracted data files.
-   `make clean-all`: Delete both the extracted files and the original downloaded archive.

## How to Add a New Dataset

1.  Create a new subdirectory in the root folder, e.g., `my-dataset`.
2.  Create a `Makefile` inside `my-dataset/`.
3.  Following the existing examples, define the dataset variables (`DATASET_NAME`, `ARCHIVE_FILE`, `URL`) and include the appropriate `recipe-*.mk` file from the root directory. Lastly, define the `all` target to trigger the `setup` process.
